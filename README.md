Employee Attrition Prediction System using Machine Learning 

This code pattern is a high-level overview of what to expect in a data science pipeline and the tools that can be used along the way. It starts from framing the business question, to buiding and deploying a data model. The pipeline is demonstrated through the employee attrition problem.

Employees are the backbone of any organization. Its performance is heavily based on the quality of the employees and retaining them. With employee attrition, organizations are faced with a number of challenges:

Expensive in terms of both money and time to train new employees
Loss of experienced employees
Impact on productivity
Impact on profit
This use case takes HR data and uses machine learning models to predict what employees will be more likely to leave given some attributes.
Such model would help an organization predict employee attrition and define a strategy to reduce such costly problem.
The input dataset is an Excel file with information about 1470 employees. 
For each employee, in addition to whether the employee left or not (attrition), there are attributes / features such as age, employee role, daily rate, job satisfaction, years at the company, years in current role, etc.

Operating Environment: Any PC with Windows operating system, Jupyter Notebook for editing of code and Python with a web browser for execution.

Some constraints that may limit the options available to the developers are: 
hardware limitations requirement of a PC at the ownerâ€™s site for running the software accompanied by a stable power supply, language constraints (the users/operators must be well-versed with English language).

The project is expected to run perfectly fine but the user cannot expect to get OTA updates, since the project is being created with a vision that it will be stable. 
However, any modifications or updates can be implemented on demand from the user.

Steps

View the completed notebook and its outputs, as is.
While viewing the notebook, you can optionally download it to store for future use.
Save and share it to others for use.


3.	System Features
	Input:  Dataset containing employee details and preferences.
	Output: Display relevant table/graph/statistics after processing raw data.
	Processing: Whenever user enters commands for displaying graph/chart, the system performs the requested operations and prints output accordingly.
 
4.	Other Nonfunctional Requirements

4.1	Performance Requirements
The user must have constant electric supply/battery power for the host device with decent specifications to support web browsing, along with a stable internet connection.
OS: Windows 7 or higher (Windows 10 Recommended)
RAM: 2GB or higher (4GB + recommended)
Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or higher

4.2	Security Requirements
The user is expected to implement minimal security features into the Desktop/Operating Machine to avoid manipulation/misuse of the application.
